# rust-playground

I've been interested in the Rust language for a little while now, and created this repository to store my projects.

## `iterator`
A function to iterate an arbitrary number of times, returning progression every 25% of the way through the cycles.

## `count-occurances`
A function where the user passes a string, and a character to count, and is given a count of that character's occurances.s
