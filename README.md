# rust-playground
I've been interested in the Rust language for a little while now, and created this repository to store my projects.

## `iterator`
A function to iterate an arbitrary number of times, returning progression every 25% of the way through the cycles.

## `count-occurences`
A function where the user passes a string, and a character to count, and is given a count of that character's occurences in the string.

## `pw-generator`
A function where the user passes in a length, and recieves a password of the given length made up of random characters.
